-# Polycraft

# THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!

Version 2.0 of the private Minecraft survival server Polycraft. 

## Getting Started

This repo will include everything that is needed to reproduce a similar server, with the exception of sensitive data such as the whitelist, API keys etc. as well as the mod loaders and mods used, please download them yourself from their respective owners.

## Background

PolyCraft V1 officially started in 2016 at Minecraft version 1.10 (Java), but has had numerous predecessors dating back to 2010. With the codebase for PolyCraft V1 becoming 5 years old, I thought I'd be a good idea to make a V2 from scratch in preperation for Minecraft version 1.18.

## How to use 

This repo is provided without the server .jar file and plugin .jar files, please download them from their respective creators. To get a working Minecraft server use the next steps: 
1. Download [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and run the .jar (or .exe) file to get the fabric .jar and vanilla .jar files.
2. Download all the mods and put them into /mods

And you're done! Now you (should) have a fully working server.
